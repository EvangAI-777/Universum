# Methodology

> How I approach analysis in this project.

---

## The Framework

Each domain is analyzed through the same lens:

1. **Current State** -- What exists, what's broken, and why
2. **First Principles** -- What would we design if starting from zero
3. **Proposals** -- Specific, concrete systems or mechanisms
4. **Evidence** -- Real-world examples that prove better is possible
5. **Unknowns** -- Honest gaps in my thinking

## Intellectual Standards

- Proposals must be specific enough to pilot
- "It should be better" is not a proposal
- Every claim should eventually have a source or reasoning chain
- Disagreement with myself is encouraged -- capture it in Open Questions
- AI-assisted research and analysis is used and disclosed

## What This Is NOT

- Not a political platform
- Not a utopian fantasy
- Not an academic paper (no formal citation style required, but sources matter)
- Not finished

## How It Grows

Domains start as empty scaffolds. Content gets added iteratively, starting with whichever domain is pulling hardest. There is no required order. Cross-domain connections get discovered as analysis deepens -- the [Connections Map](CONNECTIONS.md) captures these as they emerge.

The goal is not completeness. The goal is clarity. Better to have three well-reasoned proposals than thirty vague ones.
