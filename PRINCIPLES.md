# Principles

> Core beliefs that underpin every domain in this project.

---

These are the axioms. If a proposal in any domain contradicts these principles, either the proposal or the principle needs to change.

## On Human Nature

<!-- Design for humans as they are, not as we wish they were.
     People are capable of extraordinary good and extraordinary selfishness.
     Good systems channel both. -->

## On Systems Design

<!-- Prefer antifragile systems over merely robust ones.
     Build in feedback loops. Decentralize where possible.
     Systems should degrade gracefully, not catastrophically.
     Simplicity is a feature. -->

## On Technology & AI

<!-- AI is a thinking partner, not an oracle.
     Technology should amplify human agency, not replace it.
     Who controls the tool matters as much as what the tool does.
     The benefits of powerful technology must be widely distributed. -->

## On Scale & Dignity

<!-- Solutions must work at scale AND preserve individual dignity.
     If it works for a million people but dehumanizes one, redesign it.
     Efficiency is not the highest value. -->

## On Change

<!-- Transformation happens through demonstrated alternatives, not arguments.
     Build the better thing. Let it speak for itself.
     Incrementalism is underrated. Revolution is overrated.
     But sometimes the system needs to be replaced, not patched. -->

## On Honesty

<!-- Say what you don't know. Change your mind when evidence demands it.
     Intellectual honesty is the foundation everything else rests on.
     "I was wrong" is a strength, not a weakness. -->
