# Healthcare & Wellbeing

> How we care for physical and mental health -- and why the wealthiest civilization in history still treats healthcare as a privilege.

## Current State: What's Broken

<!-- Honest assessment of the status quo. What are the systemic failures?
     What patterns keep repeating? Who gets hurt?
     Be specific, cite real examples where possible. -->

## First Principles: Designing from Scratch

<!-- If we had no legacy systems, no political baggage, no "but that's how
     it's always been done" -- what would we build?
     What are the non-negotiable requirements?
     What are the core functions this domain must serve? -->

## Practical Proposals

<!-- Specific, implementable ideas. Not vague "we should do better" --
     actual mechanisms, structures, policies, or systems.
     Each proposal should be concrete enough that someone could
     start building or piloting it. -->

### Proposal 1: [Name]

**What:** [Brief description]
**Why:** [Problem it solves]
**How:** [Implementation sketch]
**Precedent:** [Anything similar that exists]

## What Already Works

<!-- Real-world examples, experiments, policies, communities, or
     organizations that are already doing something right.
     These are proof points -- evidence that better is possible.
     Link to sources. -->

- **[Example Name]** -- [What it does, where it operates, why it matters]

## Open Questions

<!-- Things I genuinely don't know the answer to yet.
     Tensions I haven't resolved.
     Areas where I need to research or think more. -->

- [ ] How do you fund universal healthcare without stifling medical innovation?
- [ ] What's the right balance between prevention and treatment spending?
- [ ] How should AI be integrated into diagnosis and care without dehumanizing medicine?
