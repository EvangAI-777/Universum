# Economics & Resource Distribution

> How we allocate resources, define value, and structure incentives -- and why the current system produces both billionaires and food banks.

## Current State: What's Broken

<!-- Honest assessment of the status quo. What are the systemic failures?
     What patterns keep repeating? Who gets hurt?
     Be specific, cite real examples where possible. -->

## First Principles: Designing from Scratch

<!-- If we had no legacy systems, no political baggage, no "but that's how
     it's always been done" -- what would we build?
     What are the non-negotiable requirements?
     What are the core functions this domain must serve? -->

## Practical Proposals

<!-- Specific, implementable ideas. Not vague "we should do better" --
     actual mechanisms, structures, policies, or systems.
     Each proposal should be concrete enough that someone could
     start building or piloting it. -->

### Proposal 1: [Name]

**What:** [Brief description]
**Why:** [Problem it solves]
**How:** [Implementation sketch]
**Precedent:** [Anything similar that exists]

## What Already Works

<!-- Real-world examples, experiments, policies, communities, or
     organizations that are already doing something right.
     These are proof points -- evidence that better is possible.
     Link to sources. -->

- **[Example Name]** -- [What it does, where it operates, why it matters]

## Open Questions

<!-- Things I genuinely don't know the answer to yet.
     Tensions I haven't resolved.
     Areas where I need to research or think more. -->

- [ ] Can markets be preserved while eliminating poverty?
- [ ] What does "enough" look like at a systemic level?
- [ ] How do you measure value beyond GDP?

## Connections to Other Domains

- **[Governance](../governance/index.md):** Economic rules are set by political systems; lobbying distorts both
- **[Justice](../justice/index.md):** Economic inequality produces unequal access to justice
- **[Technology](../technology/index.md):** Automation and AI are reshaping labor markets and value creation
- **[Education](../education/index.md):** Education determines economic mobility -- or locks in class structures
- **[Healthcare](../healthcare/index.md):** Health outcomes are strongly correlated with economic access
- **[Environment](../environment/index.md):** Ecological costs are externalized by economic systems
- **[Community](../community/index.md):** Economic precarity erodes social bonds and community stability
- **[Human Development](../human-development/index.md):** Purpose and meaning are hard to pursue under economic survival pressure
