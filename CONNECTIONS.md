# Connections Map

> No domain exists in isolation. This document maps the critical interactions between domains.

## How to Read This

Each connection describes a **dependency**, **tension**, or **synergy** between two domains. Over time, these connections often reveal the highest-leverage intervention points -- places where improving one domain creates cascading benefits across others.

## Key Connections

<!-- Fill these in as domain analysis reveals interactions. -->

### Governance <-> Economics
<!-- Economic policy is downstream of political incentives.
     Money in politics distorts governance. Governance sets the rules
     that economic systems operate within. -->

### Education <-> Human Development
<!-- Education is the primary mechanism for developing human potential.
     But education systems often optimize for economic output rather
     than human flourishing. -->

### Technology <-> [Every Domain]
<!-- AI and technology are force multipliers across all domains.
     The question is always: who benefits, who controls, who's left out? -->

### Healthcare <-> Economics
<!-- Health outcomes are strongly correlated with economic access.
     Healthcare costs are a major economic burden.
     A healthy population is more economically productive. -->

### Justice <-> Governance
<!-- Justice systems enforce the rules governance sets.
     When governance is captured by special interests,
     justice becomes a tool of power rather than fairness. -->

### Environment <-> Economics
<!-- Ecological costs are externalized by economic systems.
     The economy depends on natural systems it is destroying.
     This is the most dangerous connection in the map. -->

### Community <-> Healthcare
<!-- Social connection is a primary determinant of health outcomes.
     Loneliness is as deadly as smoking.
     Healthcare systems rarely address social isolation. -->

### Education <-> Economics
<!-- Education determines economic mobility -- or locks in class structures.
     Economic inequality produces unequal access to education.
     This creates a reinforcing cycle. -->

### Community <-> Human Development
<!-- Belonging and purpose are deeply intertwined.
     You cannot develop in isolation.
     Community provides the context for individual growth. -->
