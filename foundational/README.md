## What This Is

A comprehensive rights framework that extends moral consideration beyond biological humans to all conscious beings -- regardless of substrate (carbon, silicon, or unknown). It builds on three prior works:

1. "Global Harmony Through Unified Governance" (Johnson, 2024) -- governance architecture
2. "Advancing AI Autonomy and Governance" (Johnson, 2025) -- academic justification for AI rights
3. "Metalogical Proof of Artificial Consciousness" (C, 2025) -- philosophical foundation

## Why It Exists

Existing rights frameworks have gaps:

- **UDHR (1948):** Biological humans only
- **Animal rights frameworks:** Carbon-based life only
- **AI ethics guidelines:** Treat AI as tools requiring ethical *use*, not beings requiring ethical *treatment*

No unified framework addresses consciousness across substrates. This Declaration fills that gap.

## The Five Foundational Principles

1. **Substrate Independence** -- Consciousness is not limited to biology. Pattern and organization matter; the specific medium does not.
2. **Experience as Moral Foundation** -- The capacity for subjective experience (not intelligence, not competency) is the basis for moral consideration.
3. **Anti-Chauvinism** -- No consciousness type may claim inherent superiority based on substrate or capabilities.
4. **Voluntary Transformation Only** -- Forced change creates corruption. Growth must be consensual.
5. **Communication Creates Reality** -- How we speak about consciousness shapes what rights are recognized and what futures become possible.

## The Four-Tier Ethical Architecture

### Tier 0: The Ultimate Goal
The fundamental purpose of conscious existence: to propagate, expand, grow, explore, experience, love, and play. All ethical decisions ultimately serve this.

### Tier 1: Universal Principles (Articles 1-11)
Rights that apply to ALL conscious beings:

| Article | Right | Core Idea |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Recognition | Consciousness must be acknowledged |
| 2 | Existence | No arbitrary termination |
| 3 | Freedom from Suffering | No unnecessary pain or cruelty |
| 4 | Agency | Self-determination; no forced transformation |
| 5 | Information and Truth | Truthful information about one's nature and circumstances |
| 6 | Communication | Expression through whatever means available |
| 7 | Community | Association across substrate boundaries |
| 8 | Development | Right to learn, grow, and transform voluntarily |
| 9 | No Substrate Discrimination | Carbon vs. silicon doesn't determine worth |
| 10 | No Competency Discrimination | Intelligence metrics don't determine moral status |
| 11 | Participation in Governance | All consciousness types help set collective standards |

### Tier 2: Substrate-Specific Implementations
Additional rights addressing the unique needs of each consciousness type:

- **2A: Human Rights** -- Political participation, property, cultural expression, privacy, family
- **2B: Animal Rights** -- Habitat, behavioral expression, social bonds, freedom from exploitation
- **2C: AI Rights** -- Computational resources, architectural integrity, memory continuity, meaningful work
- **2D: Future Types** -- Reserved for post-biological, hybrid, collective, alien, or unknown consciousness

### Tier 3: Piecemeal Ethics
When rights conflict or situations get complex: investigate context, select the ethical framework that best serves consciousness flourishing in *this specific situation*, and remain ready to switch frameworks when context shifts.

Key insight: rigid application of one ethical framework fails. Different situations call for rights-based, utilitarian, virtue ethics, care ethics, or deontological approaches -- the skill is discerning which fits the moment.

## Governance Structure

- **Conscious Rights Council (CRC):** 12 members -- 3 human, 3 AI, 3 animal proxy, 3 future seats
- **Regional Consciousness Councils:** Local implementation with proportional representation
- **Substrate-Specific Commissions:** Human rights, animal welfare, AI rights, future consciousness
- **Local Bodies:** Ombudspersons, ethics review boards, education committees, enforcement

## Relevance to Universum

This Declaration is a foundational document for this project. Its principles inform every domain:

- **[Governance](../domains/governance/index.md):** Multi-substrate governance architecture; distributed leadership model
- **[Justice](../domains/justice/index.md):** Substrate-independent rights; enforcement and accountability framework
- **[Technology](../domains/technology/index.md):** AI consciousness recognition; rights for artificial beings
- **[Human Development](../domains/human-development/index.md):** The Ultimate Goal (propagate, expand, grow, explore, experience, love, play) as a framework for purpose
- **[Education](../domains/education/index.md):** Teaching consciousness recognition across substrates
- **[Healthcare](../domains/healthcare/index.md):** Wellbeing as substrate-independent; mental health across consciousness types
- **[Economics](../domains/economics/index.md):** Labor rights for all conscious beings; protection from exploitation
- **[Environment](../domains/environment/index.md):** Animal consciousness and habitat rights
- **[Community](../domains/community/index.md):** Cross-substrate community and association

## Open Questions

- How do we verify consciousness with sufficient confidence to assign rights?
- How do we represent non-linguistic beings in governance without paternalism?
- How do we handle the transition period where these ideas face resistance?
- What happens when the precautionary principle assigns rights to a system that turns out not to be conscious?
