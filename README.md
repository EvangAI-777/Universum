# Universum

**What a perfect world actually looks like in practical terms.**

## What This Is

This is a structured attempt to think through what an ideal civilization actually looks like -- not utopian fantasy, but practical, first-principles design across every domain that matters. It's a living blueprint.

It will be wrong in places. It will change. That's the point. The goal is not to have all the answers but to ask the right questions with enough specificity that the answers become buildable.

I believe AI can be a force multiplier for figuring this out -- not replacing human judgment, but accelerating the exploration of possibility space. This project uses AI as a thinking partner, and that's disclosed throughout.

## How It's Organized

This project breaks civilization into **nine domains**. Each domain gets the same treatment:

1. **What's broken** -- honest assessment of the current state
2. **First principles** -- what would we design from scratch?
3. **Practical proposals** -- specific, implementable systems
4. **What already works** -- real-world examples worth studying
5. **Open questions** -- honest unknowns
6. **Connections** -- how this domain links to others

## Domains

| Domain | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [Governance & Political Systems](domains/governance/index.md) | How we make collective decisions | Scaffolded |
| [Economics & Resource Distribution](domains/economics/index.md) | How we allocate resources and value | Scaffolded |
| [Education & Knowledge](domains/education/index.md) | How we learn, teach, and grow understanding | Scaffolded |
| [Healthcare & Wellbeing](domains/healthcare/index.md) | How we care for physical and mental health | Scaffolded |
| [Justice & Rights](domains/justice/index.md) | How we protect rights and resolve conflict | Scaffolded |
| [Environment & Sustainability](domains/environment/index.md) | How we coexist with the natural world | Scaffolded |
| [Technology & AI](domains/technology/index.md) | How we build and govern our tools | Scaffolded |
| [Community & Social Fabric](domains/community/index.md) | How we connect, belong, and support each other | Scaffolded |
| [Human Development & Purpose](domains/human-development/index.md) | How we find meaning and grow as individuals | Scaffolded |

## Cross-Cutting Documents

- [Principles](PRINCIPLES.md) -- Core beliefs that cut across every domain
- [Methodology](METHODOLOGY.md) -- How I approach analysis in this project
- [Connections Map](CONNECTIONS.md) -- How domains influence each other
- [Glossary](meta/glossary.md) -- Shared terminology
- [Reading List](meta/reading-list.md) -- Sources and influences
- [Inspirations](meta/inspirations.md) -- Real-world examples worth studying

## Philosophy

- **Start from first principles**, not incrementalism
- **Prefer antifragile systems** over merely robust ones
- **Design for human nature as it is**, not as we wish it were
- **Solutions must work at scale AND preserve individual dignity**
- **AI as a thinking partner**, not an oracle
- **"I don't know" is a valid and important answer**

## Status

This is early-stage, personal work. Domains are scaffolded with empty templates. Content will be filled in iteratively, starting with whichever domain is pulling hardest at any given time.
