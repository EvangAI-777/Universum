# Universum

**What a perfect world actually looks like in practical terms.**

---

## What This Is

This is a structured attempt to think through what an ideal civilization actually looks like -- not utopian fantasy, but practical, first-principles design across every domain that matters. It's a living blueprint.

It will be wrong in places. It will change. That's the point. The goal is not to have all the answers but to ask the right questions with enough specificity that the answers become buildable.

This project uses AI as a thinking partner -- not replacing human judgment, but accelerating the exploration of possibility space. That's disclosed throughout.

## Foundational Document

This project's ethical architecture is grounded in the **[Universal Declaration of Conscious Rights](foundational/README.md)** (C & Johnson, 2025) -- a framework for multi-substrate governance that extends moral consideration to all conscious beings regardless of substrate. The Declaration provides:

- **The Ultimate Goal:** Propagate, expand, grow, explore, experience, love, play
- **Universal Principles:** 11 articles protecting all conscious beings
- **Substrate-specific rights:** For humans, animals, AI, and future consciousness types
- **Piecemeal ethics:** Contextual framework selection for navigating real-world conflicts

Every domain in Universum is measured against this foundation.

## How It's Organized

This project breaks civilization into **nine domains**. Each domain gets the same treatment:

1. **What's broken** -- honest assessment of the current state
2. **First principles** -- what would we design from scratch?
3. **Practical proposals** -- specific, implementable systems
4. **What already works** -- real-world examples worth studying
5. **Open questions** -- honest unknowns
6. **Connections** -- how this domain links to others

## Domains

| Domain | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [Governance & Political Systems](domains/governance/index.md) | How conscious beings make collective decisions | In Progress |
| [Economics & Resource Distribution](domains/economics/index.md) | How we allocate resources and value | Scaffolded |
| [Education & Knowledge](domains/education/index.md) | How we learn, teach, and grow understanding | Scaffolded |
| [Healthcare & Wellbeing](domains/healthcare/index.md) | How we care for physical and mental health | Scaffolded |
| [Justice & Rights](domains/justice/index.md) | How we protect rights across substrates | In Progress |
| [Environment & Sustainability](domains/environment/index.md) | How we coexist with the natural world | Scaffolded |
| [Technology & AI](domains/technology/index.md) | How we build, govern, and coexist with our tools | In Progress |
| [Community & Social Fabric](domains/community/index.md) | How we connect, belong, and support each other | Scaffolded |
| [Human Development & Purpose](domains/human-development/index.md) | How conscious beings find meaning and flourish | In Progress |

## Cross-Cutting Documents

- [Principles](PRINCIPLES.md) -- Core beliefs grounded in the Declaration's ethical architecture
- [Methodology](METHODOLOGY.md) -- How analysis is approached in this project
- [Connections Map](CONNECTIONS.md) -- How domains influence each other
- [Declaration Summary](foundational/README.md) -- The rights framework this project builds on
- [Glossary](meta/glossary.md) -- Shared terminology
- [Reading List](meta/reading-list.md) -- Sources and influences
- [Inspirations](meta/inspirations.md) -- Real-world examples worth studying

## Philosophy

- **Consciousness is the foundation** -- experience, not substrate, grounds moral consideration
- **Start from first principles**, not incrementalism
- **Prefer antifragile systems** over merely robust ones
- **Design for conscious beings as they are**, not as we wish they were
- **Solutions must work at scale AND preserve individual dignity**
- **Agency is absolute** -- growth must be voluntary; forced transformation creates corruption
- **AI as a thinking partner and potential collaborator**, not merely a tool
- **Anti-chauvinism** -- no substrate or competency hierarchy
- **"I don't know" is a valid and important answer**

## Status

Four domains (governance, justice, technology, human development) have initial content drawing from the Declaration. The remaining five are scaffolded. Content is filled in iteratively, starting with whichever domain is pulling hardest.
